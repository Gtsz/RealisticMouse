RealisticMouse
==============

RealisticMouse is a simple project that will detail how to achieve a semi-realistic (ie. Human) mouse movement via C++.

##Problem Summery 
If you have ever used the basic Windows API whether your are using Send Input, SetCusuorPos, Mouse_event you will notice how unnatural these mouse movements appear. Even if you slow these mouse movements and/or use linear interpolation they still appear to not be passable. 

##Motivation 
My motivation behind this project was to defeat certain heuristics that are currently being developed, and depolyed by some game developers in an attempt to ensure that mouse movements are genuine. 

##Basics
In this project I basically achieve this via Factorials, Bernstein basis, Bezier Curves, Gaussian Distribution.

##Update
Current bugs: Excessive arc in some situations. (Fix Soon<sup>TM</sup>)
